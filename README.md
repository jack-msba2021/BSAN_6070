Exploring India’s Air Pollution Through Data Analysis

Project Overview

Exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their characteristics. It’s a very important step in data analysis that should be performed before any real complex statistical methods are conducted. This project attempts to practice the concepts of exploratory data analysis through the India Air Quality Dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
